# Disease-prediction-from-medical-data

Disease Prediction from Medical Data Create a disease prediction model based on medical data, including symptoms and patient history. Utilize datasets with labeled medical records and apply classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of a disease. The model aims to assist in early detection by analyzing patient information and identifying potential health issues.

These tasks encompass a diverse range of machine learning applications, from financial risk assessment to speech emotion recognition and healthcare-related disease prediction. Each task requires the application of classification algorithms and showcases the versatility of machine learning in solving real-world problems.
